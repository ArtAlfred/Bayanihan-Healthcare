              a. Treatment and Communication<br />
              <br />

              Your health information is used to provide you with medical
              treatment or services. We may use and share health information
              about you with physicians, nurses, allied medical personnel,
              residents, fellows and medical students, or other TMC personnel
              involved in your care. Different departments of the hospital may
              also share health information about you to coordinate the services
              you need, such as pharmacy, dietary, laboratory and other
              diagnostic centers.<br />
              <br />

              In special cases, we may also disclose your health information to
              providers not affiliated with the Hospital to facilitate care or
              treatment they provide you. These include other physicians outside
              The Medical City who are involved in your care outside the
              hospital setting or in case of hospital transfers, to the
              receiving hospital. <br />
              <br />

              Electronic exchange of health information helps ensure better
              coordination of care. The physicians and nurses of The Medical
              City utilize digital technology in order to facilitate quicker and
              prompt referrals within the healthcare team. They may use
              messaging platforms such as SMS, emails, Viber, Telegram, and
              other similar services in order to communicate with the team.
              Alternatively, you may access your results through our online
              platform. <br />
              <br />

              Upon your request, we may send electronic results of your
              laboratory and other diagnostic tests to you or your authorized
              representative. We may also use and disclose health information to
              contact you as a reminder that you have an appointment for care at
              The Medical City. We will communicate with you using the
              information (such as telephone number and email address) that you
              provide us. <br />
              <br />

              Unless you notify us to the contrary, we may use the contact
              information you provide to communicate general information about
              your care such as appointment location, department, date and time,
              as well as for patient experience and satisfaction surveys. <br />
              <br />

              b. Billing and Collection <br />
              <br />

              We may use and disclose your personal and health information to
              confirm, bill and receive payment for health care services that we
              or others provide to you. This includes submission of your health
              information to receive payment from Philhealth, your health
              maintenance organization (HMO), insurance company, or other party
              that pays for some or all of your health care or to verify that
              your payor will pay for your health care. We may also tell your
              payor about a treatment you are going to receive to determine
              whether your payor will cover the treatment. For certain services,
              if your permission is needed to release health information to
              obtain payment, you will be asked for permission. <br />
              <br />

              In cases of non-payment, your personal and health information will
              be sent to legal services for collection purposes who may conduct
              credit investigations and send demand letters to collect payment
              for services rendered to you. <br />
              <br />

              c. Health Care Processes and Professional Services <br />
              <br />

              We may use and disclose health information for health care
              operations. This includes functions necessary to run The Medical
              City and assure that all patients receive quality care. We may
              also share your information with affiliated health care providers
              so that they may jointly perform certain business operations along
              with TMC. We may combine health information about many of our
              patients to improve on the services being offered, to determine
              what services are no longer needed and to assess whether certain
              treatments are effective. <br />
              <br />

              We may share information with physicians, nurses, allied medical
              personnel, residents, fellows and medical students, or other TMC
              personnel to ensure quality assurance and compliance with
              standards of care. We may also compare the health information we
              have with information from other hospitals to see where we can
              improve the care and services we offer. In these instances, The
              Medical City will work to anonymize, mask, encrypt or de-identify
              your personal and health information as much as possible. <br />
              <br />

              The Hospital contracts with outside entities that perform business
              services for us, such as the Joint Commission International,
              government entities, billing companies, management consultants,
              quality assurance reviewers, accounting or legal firms. In certain
              circumstances, we may need to share your health information with a
              business associate so it can perform a service on our behalf. We
              will have a data sharing agreement or written contract in place
              with the business associate requiring protection of the privacy
              and security of your health information. <br />
              <br />

              d. Legal Compliance and Health-Related Services <br />
              <br />

              We may disclose your information to the Department of Health and
              other appropriate government entities for activities authorized by
              law such as audits, investigations, inspections, and licensure.
              <br />
              <br />

              When necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health and
              safety or the health and safety of others, we may use and disclose
              certain information about you. Such disclosure will only be to
              someone able to prevent or respond to the threat, such as law
              enforcement, or a potential victim. <br />
              <br />

              We may also use or disclose health information about you when
              required to do so by laws not specifically mentioned in this
              Policy. <br />
              <br />

              e. Research and Training <br />
              <br />

              Public Health (ASMPH), medical students may use and access your
              health information. We will have a data sharing agreement or

              Being a training ground for future doctor specialists with over
              ten accredited residency and fellowship programs, your health
              information may be used and disclosed in training and education.
              Daily endorsement rounds, weekly department conferences, audits,
              morbidity, and mortality conferences are requirements for
              continued accreditation of our clinical programs and may involve
              the use of your health information. Limited information about you
              and your treatment may be used for the purposes of accreditation
              of our residency and fellowship programs and specialty board
              certification of our trainees. <br />
              <br />

              The Medical City has an active research program. We generally ask
              for your written authorization before asking you to participate,
              use your health information, or share it with others to conduct
              research. Under limited circumstances, we may use and disclose
              your health information without your authorization. In these
              situations, we will anonymize, mask, encrypt or de-identify data
              to protect your information and so that no patient is individually
              identifiable. We will obtain approval through an independent
              review process to ensure that research conducted without your
              authorization poses minimal risk to your privacy. <br />
              <br />

              are not required to agree to your requested restriction. However,
