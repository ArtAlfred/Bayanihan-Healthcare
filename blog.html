            How Bayanihan Healthcare Works
          </h4>
          <p class="vio-green my-3">
            <span class="fw-semibold vio-green">Step 1:</span>Registration -
            Users can create a free account on our website by providing basic
            personal information such as name, email, and phone number. They can
            also add their medical history and preferences, which helps us
            provide personalized healthcare services. Other than that they can
            also make an appointment without creating an account. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="fw-semibold vio-green">Step 2:</span> Location - Users
            can use our location-based services to find healthcare providers and
            clinics near their area. They can filter their search by specialty,
            rating, availability, and price, making it easier to find the right
            healthcare provider for their needs.
            <br />
            <br />
            <span class="fw-semibold vio-green">Step 3:</span> Booking - Once
            users have found a healthcare provider that meets their needs, they
            can book an appointment directly through our website. They can
            choose the date, time, and location of the appointment, and receive
            confirmation via email or SMS. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="fw-semibold vio-green">Step 4:</span> Consultation - On
            the day of the appointment, users can visit the healthcare provider
            at the specified location and time. Our website provides a digital
            appointment card that users can show to the provider, which includes
            all the relevant information about the appointment.
          </p>

          <h4 class="vio-green fw-semibold mt-5">Online appointment booking</h4>
          <p class="vio-green my-3">
            Online appointment booking is a convenient and efficient way for
            patients to schedule healthcare appointments through the Bayanihan
            Healthcare website. With just a few clicks, patients can easily find
            a healthcare provider in their area, select a preferred date and
            time for their appointment, and receive confirmation of their
            booking. This eliminates the need for patients to spend time on the
            phone trying to schedule appointments, and allows them to book
            appointments at any time of the day or night, from the comfort of
            their own homes. Online appointment booking also reduces waiting
            times at healthcare facilities and helps to streamline the entire
            healthcare process, making it more convenient for both patients and
            healthcare providers alike. With Bayanihan Healthcare's online
            appointment booking system, patients can easily manage their
            healthcare needs and focus on their overall health and wellbeing.

            Bayanihan Healthcare's location-based services use advanced
            technology to help patients find healthcare providers in their area.
            By using GPS and other location-based technologies, our website can
            quickly identify healthcare providers in close proximity to a
            patient's location.
