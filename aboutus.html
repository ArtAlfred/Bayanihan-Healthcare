            <h2>Our Service Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              BAYANIHAN HealthCare has defined for itself the value proposition:
              <i>“Services for all Filipinos” </i> This phrase finds its fullest
              meaning when the patient is viewed not as a problem to be solved
              or a charge to be cared for, but as a partner in his own health.
              Patient partnership means acknowledging the patient's fundamental
              accountability for his own health, then supporting this with
              systems, tools and venues for education, open communication, and
              informed choice. This fresh perspective on the patient's role in
              health care represents a radical departure from the traditional
              idea of the patient as a passive recipient of medical services.
